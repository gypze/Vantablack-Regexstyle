# Vantablack: A Regex Hexadecimal Turorial

If you've ever worked with web design, you've likely encountered hexadecimal color codes. These codes, like #ffff (white) or #000000 (black), define colors for websites. But how do we ensure that a color code is valid? This is where regex, or regular expressions, come into play.

## Summary

The regex /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ is designed to validate hexadicimal color codes. It ensures the code is either 3 or 6 characters long, optionally starts with a #, and only contains valid hecadicimal characters (0-9, a-f).
